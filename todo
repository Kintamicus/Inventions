Run down of Inventions:

	Goal - 
		Experimenting and discovering techniques that can eventually be combined to create a new invention
	
	Techniques -
		Techniques are the currency in this mod. They are static and can be shared with others using textbooks and
		handwritten notes. 
			# Once a technique is discovered, it must be written down or else it will slowly degrade
			Techniques are discovered by analysing items and blocks
		
	Experiments - 
		Experiments require Techniques and create more Techniques. 
			# Experiments are always conducted on a TestBed multiblock 1x1, 3x3, 5x5, 7x7, or 9x9
				Experiments are written down in a log book, at the cost of XP it will be given
					- Terminal Velocity
					- Controlled Speed
					- Softening 
					- Lust for Blood
			# TestBeds
				Assortment of sensors are scattered around a TestBed on sensor racks. Each sensor watches a player on
				a testbed surface and a sensor controller outputs techniques learned
